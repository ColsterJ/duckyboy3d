There have been some changes to the way some of the cameras work in order to help smoothe them out.
If you don't care about these changes and want to use the older version, then you will need to use the "OldV1" version of your camera script.
You will be able to find "BasicCameraControllerOldV1", "FollowCameraControllerOldV1", and "HoldPositionCameraControllerOldV1".

If you want to use the new changes, then for both the Basic and Follow camera controllers, put the camera as a child of the TARGET game object you are using.
The update now uses the FixedUpdate instead of the regular Update, so it should work better with physics based movement.

NOTE: As you can see in the Basic2 example scene. If you put the camera as a child of the target object, and the target object rotates, the camera will too.
If you are basing the rotation of the target object in world space on the camera's virtual transform, this can cause jumpiness as the camera rotates twice and then pops back.
You can fix this by unattaching the camera from it's parent and then reattaching it after declaring the rotation.
