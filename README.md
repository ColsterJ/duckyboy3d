This is a frontend for Doom source ports like Doom Retro that makes playing quick "coffee-break" games of Doom more fun and less predictable by randomizing level selection and even IWAD/mod selection and, in the future, doing other things like tracking WAD completion rates, letting players "Favorite" levels they enjoy especially, and doing quests/challenges like playing an entire level with fists only or completing a WAD on a particular difficulty.

It also makes the experience of playing Doom on your TV more accessible by offering a TV- and gamepad-friendly UI.

NOTE: You must currently have DOOM Retro installed in "C:\\Users\\C Jones\\Documents\\Unity\\Repos\\DoomArcade\\Build\\DoomRetro\\" and WADs present in "[that directory]\game_WADs\"
